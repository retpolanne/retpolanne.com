I'm currently working on a GeoDjango app that has some weird memory leak. After a short while, the server
process dies due to OOM. I wanted to understand why this was happening.

My approach was:

1. Disable DEBUG - [bug report](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31419#ticket)
2. Add an URL pattern that receives start/end and calls a simple view that generates snapshots
3. Compare both snapshots from start to end
