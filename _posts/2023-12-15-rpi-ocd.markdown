I'm trying to debug the Renesas XHCI bug using the Raspberry Pi CM4 (which has a PCI interface). However, it doesn't 
support IOMMU, so I can't debug using QEMU... I bought a JTAG then and I'm going to use it with OpenOCD :)

## Installing GDB Multiarch on Arch Linux

```sh
yay -S gdb-multiarch
```

I've built openocd from the source.
