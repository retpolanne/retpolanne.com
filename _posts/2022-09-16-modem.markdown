# Making a call blocker

So, my dad still have a landline, in 2022. And it's being spammed with robocalls. 

It's so annoying that I decided to use a Raspberry Pi as a call blocker. For that, I need to play with an USB modem! 

## Call blocking solutions

I'll keep them out of scope to be honest, since they are their environment on their own. Links for the tool that I want to use is on [1].

To make it work, I figured out I needed:

- a Raspberry Pi
- an USB Modem (I bought a Trendnet Tfm-561U)
- a splitter

You'll have something like this (I hope Jekyll doesn't break it :( )



{% highlight text %}
  phone      --------- |
                       |---  splitter --- my isp router
  usb modem  --------- | 
{% endhighlight %}

Now that I have everything, here's the problems.

## Caller ID... doesn't work! 

In order to check if the telephone is ringing, you need a tool with a very interesting name... a name that Brazilians can't read without laughing.

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt install cu
{% endhighlight %}

That's the name of the tool, cu.

Anyways, I recommend running cu on tmux, since it holds your tty. You can't exit cu. 

Also, I needed to change my user to the dialout group. 

{% highlight bash %}
sudo usermod -aG dialout pinkiepie
{% endhighlight %}

And them start cu attached to /dev/ttyACM0. By making a call, it should show up the RING and the caller id, right?

{% highlight bash %}
cu -l /dev/ttyACM0
Connected.

RING

RING
{% endhighlight %}

No caller id :( 

I need to figure out two things: 

- does the modem support caller id?
- does it support DTMF or FSK?
- do my landline use DTMF or FSK?

I've bought a DTMF to FSK converter anyways. :money-with-wings:

And also need to find my modem's chipset.

## Finding the modem's chipset

You can basically run lsusb to get the VID:PID, but you can get the chipset model from cu

{% highlight bash %}
cu -l /dev/ttyACM0 
Connected.
ATI3
CX93001-EIS_V0.2002-V92
{% endhighlight%}

Found out about this on [2].

lsusb tells me it's a Conexant. From the Trendnet Tfm-561U datasheet, it says it supports DTMF. 

I tried enabling VCID, and it says OK, but nothing shows when it rings.

{% highlight bash %}
AT+VCID=1
OK
{% endhighlight%}

## Dialing 

On the same forum [2] someone suggested using ATDT for dialing. This guide [3] teaches how to do this. 

It's basically like this:

{% highlight bash %}
ATD+55yyxxxxxxxx;
OK
{% endhighlight%}

It says ok, but doesn't ring my cellphone.

Ringing without DDD works!

{% highlight bash %}
ATDT xxxxxxxxx
{% endhighlight%}

It was nice messing up with this, but the DTMF/FSK converter should arrive on monday. Hopefully no one will call this weekend. 

To be continued.
