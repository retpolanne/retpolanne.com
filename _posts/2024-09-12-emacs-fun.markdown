## Emacs and dotfiles taught me how to have fun with a computer again

I haven't had fun with a computer for a long long time.

Ever since I joined Nubank, I started learning emacs. At first I would shy away from complicated 
elisp code. But after months of studying and working with Clojure, I started to realize that I 
definitely love lisp. I've spent countless hours this week playing with emacs elisp and installing
all kinds of interesting packages. At some point I want to go from doom emacs to vanilla emacs, but
that will take some time.

In fact, you can live on emacs, and use emacs as an operating system. You can send emails on emacs, 
you can do all sorts of things. And it's highly hackable! 

I also started setting up a dotfiles repo for installing and configuring things. Dotfiles are also
a quite fun and easy way of setting up your laptop. You can see them, but do not fork them please. [1]

My dotfiles are available [here](https://github.com/retpolanne/dotfiles).

One thing I've been doing with them is doing symlinking of the directories and files so they are updated
everytime I change something on the git repo.
