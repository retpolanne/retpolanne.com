# Kernel Dev - The Renesas Journey

I'm back with my blog! And it's as shiny and brand new as possible. 

This is the story of my journey with a Renesas XHCI host controller from a very weird PCI-e USB-C card. 

## Prologue 

So, I've recently bought a Corsair 5000x case for my computer. It's a nice and shiny case and I couldn't stop staring at it. 
It comes with a USB-C on the front panel, which is handy for using my Yubikey.

So, I use my Yubikey to decrypt LUKS, so instead of asking for a password it asks for the Yubikey and user presence 
(I know, this isn't as safe, so I'm going to also somehow add the TPM pin to it). 

After I setup everything, I tried to use the Yubikey on the front panel and... didn't work? Why isn't it working. 
I tried also adding a Divoom speaker I have and I saw that it was charging so it wasn't a power management issue. What is the problem?

I realized that there was a cable from my front panel that I didn't know where it fit. Guess what: this is the USB-C cable!

Where does it fit? My mobo doesn't have this header! So, I had to buy a PCI-e card for it. 

### The card... doesn't work

I bought the first card I found on MercadoLivre, a PH61 card. I plugged it in, connected the USB-C header cable, turned on my PC. 
The Yubikey didn't fire up ðŸ¤¡. Divoom did power up, but didn't show up on the drivers. `lsusb` didn't list it but `lspci` did! 

I rebooted onto Windows and saw that the driver was failing to load for some reason. At some point, I assumed the card dead and just 
ordered a new one from AliExpress. 

## Enters the kernel

Okay, even though I did order a new one, my curiosity was chiming on me: why isn't it working? It's just a software issue, and you can 
fix software issues!

So the first thing I did was a `dmesg` and voilÃ¡, I found the error. 

*TODO* add the error here from dmesg.

I googled the error, just like everyone does, and I found an email from the person who coded the driver stating the same error [1]. 

So these were the lines that controlled this timeout, on the `drivers/usb/host/xhci-pci-renesas.c`:

```c
#define RENESAS_RETRY	1000
#define RENESAS_DELAY	10
```

I decided to follow this guide [2] to clone the kernel, did a quick and dirty patch of these values. 
I changed the XHCI configs to make it loadable instead of built in. Compiled the kernel, installed it, booted it, the card was still failing to load. 
Then I changed these macros for delay and retry and recompiled just the module. I did recompile the whole kernel before doing it I believe.

*TODO* add zstd commands
```sh
make M=drivers/usb/host/xhci-pci-renesas.c

```
