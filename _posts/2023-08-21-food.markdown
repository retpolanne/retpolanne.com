I took a break from kernel debugging (since my life became a turmoil recently) and moved out of my parents' house.

Things are going quite well, except for cooking. I've been ordering a lot of food, a lot of unhealthy and expensive food...

For this reason, I decided to compile some recipes of my favorite food, things that I can easily prepare and that are mostly vegetarian or vegan 
(I still eat meat, but I think meat can be annoyingly poisonous if you don't repare/store it correctly). 

While researching, I've also been finding old blogs from people talking about veganism, vegetarianism and sharing interesting recipes. I prefer 
following recipes from blogs, Idk why. I'll also share some Youtube videos, but I definitely prefer food blogging.
