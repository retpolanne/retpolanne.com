This part of the story can be quite challenging to write about. There's just a lot of things to cover this time, so bear with me 
for a little while.

This is my post egg-cracking story, one that continues to this day and will continue maybe, probably, _forever_.

## Transness

The thing about transness is that being a trans woman is just a fact about my life. You see, typical, cisgender people, most of them never
had to question whether they are a man or a woman. It's just like why 2+2=4: it's easy to tell, the most obvious thing in the world, yet
so hard to explain why this phenomenon happens.

I think the same goes for being trans or non-binary - although we're usually forced to explain why we're trans (and we try to come 
up with reasons, only to understand that we're just scraping the subject of _gender stereotypes_ that aren't hard truths) it's still
just a fact about ourselves. I understand people trying to take it to the medical, psychological, societal, even philosophical sides 
to try to explain transness, it's still __just a fact__. We are what we are, and that's it. That's why we talk so much of acceptance, 
rather than explanation.

they kind of knew.

As I was more open with my mother and my aunt, I would explain to them these gender ideas through the Gender Unicorn [1], which proved
helpful and a powerful tool for explaining all things gender and sexuality.

It was a little hard for me to tell my father I was trans, and at first he took it with some
